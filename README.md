An app to browse, documentate, discover REST APIs 

ExploREST is a generic app which let you explore REST API. 
There is two main use cases :
* You can use it as a tool to browse resources of any API you want (using HTTP methods).
* You can use it as your own documentation tool for your API REST.


Features:
* Cross-resource exploration: when a resource has a link to another resource, you can directly click it to access it.
* Formatted, highlighted JSON.
* Markdown to documentate your API
* Playground links: insert them in you Markdown. When you click on them, if makes a get request and diplays the result !
* Sample links: idem. When you click on them, it makes the POST or DELETE requests you specified in the Markdown. It is very practical for demonstrations, or to communicate with someone else: instead of making a curl (more efforts needed), put a sample link into the markdown for once. Now other people just have to click it !
