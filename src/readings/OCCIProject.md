## The OCCIware project

The aim of the OCCI project is to normalize and unify the Cloud.  
If you use the cloud today and want to change your Cloud provider, it is really painful because the way of managing the Cloud is
different depending on the provider you use.    

OCCIware is an organization working on an implementation of the [OCCI specifications](http://occi-wg.org/about/specification/). It created an OCCI compliant server, named Erocci,
wich you can deploy on your Cloud, and wich exposes the REST API you are currently using through this playground.

##Â As a user

The idea is pretty simple : you choose a Cloud provider, you deploy your Erocci server on it, you configure it with the right kinds of resources you are using
(databases, VMs, WordPress blog ...), then you can manage your resources with the REST API or with this application. Let's say after some time, you decide to change
you Cloud provider : no need to learn a new managing style of the Cloud anymore, just deploy you Erocci server, and you are ready to go !
